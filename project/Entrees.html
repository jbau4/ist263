            <h2>Define Entrees...</h2>
            <p>To me, entrees are complete meals. These are full encompassing dishes that are plated with a main dish and a side of vegetables. I like to call entrees "well rounded" meals... but lets be honest, we just love how much food is on our plate!</p></article><br>

                <li>Salt</li>
            </ul>
            <h7>Directions</h7>
            <ol>
                <li>Rince your rice thoroughly and add to a pot with water.</li>
                <li>Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Let it cook for 15 minutes and then remove the heat and let it sit for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>While the rice cooks, dice up your ahi tuna until its almost like a paste consistency. Then let it rest in the fridge for 10 minutes</li>
                <li>To a bowl, add your kewpie mayo, siracha, salt, pepper, drizzle of sesame oil, and garlic powder and mix to combine. </li>
                <li>Remove your tuna from the fridge and pour your siracha mayo on it and mix until it is well combined. </li>
                <li>Combine your rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small pot. Cook and mix it until all of the ingredients combine</li>
                <li>Remove your cooked rice to a seperate bowl and pour your rice vinegar mixture on it and mix thoroughly. It should be rather sticky now.</li>
                <li>Let the rice cool while you heat up a pan with a generouse amount of sesame oil (enough to fry)</li>
                <li>Form your cooled rice into whatever shape you want. It is best to form it into little rectangles.</li>
                <li>Once the oil is piping hot (check using a wooden chopstick if it bubbles it is ready to fry) add your rice rectangles to it and fry for about 2-3 minutes each side before flipping.</li>
                <li>While your rice fries, steam your frozen edamame, and then sprinkle it with salt.</li>
                <li>Once cooked, remove rice from the oil onto a tray lined with paper towel to absorb excess oil. Let it sit for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Finally, scoop about a table spoonful of your spicy tuna on top of each rice cake and sprinkle your chives on each one. Enjoy!</li>
