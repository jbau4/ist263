            <h2>The Beauty of Pastas</h2>
            <p>Pasta is one of the simplest yet most delicious foods you could make. Pasta is one of my ultimate comfort foods. It is a cuisine that can impress even the pickiest of eaters. However, whether it’s fresh pasta or straight from the box it doesn’t matter… The most important part of it is how you make the sauce.

            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
                <li>Pasta of your choice | Chef reccomends: Rigatoni or Penne</li>
                <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
                <li>Olive Oil</li>
                <li>Fresh Basil</li>
                <li>White onions or shallots if you want it sweeter</li>
                <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
                <li>1 can tomato paste</li>
                <li>1-2 shots of vodka | Chef reccomends: Grey Goose</li>
                <li>Heavy cream</li>
                <li>Parmigiano reggiano </li>
                <li>Butter</li>
         </ul><br>
         <h5>Directions</h5>
         <ol>
             <li>Boil your water and add a generous amount of salt to the water.</li>
             <li>Pour a generous amount of olive oil into a pan and turn on the heat. While that heats up, dice your onions and mince your garlic. Once hot add a generous amount of red pepper flakes to the oil to emulsify and then toss in your onions. 
            </li>
            <li>Add salt and pepper to your onions while they cook. Once the onions start to brown add your minced garlic (garlic burns faster so wait for the onions to cook before adding). 
            </li>
            <li>Once everything starts to brown, add your can of tomato paste and stir it around mixing it with the onions and garlic. Once completely mixed, let it cook down for about 2-3 minutes so that the tartness of the tomato paste burns off. 
            </li>
            <li>After 2-3 minutes add a shot or two of vodka and mix. Let the vodka cook down and reduce for about a minute. 
            </li>
            <li>Once the alcohol has burned off it's time to add your heavy cream. Stir that around well making sure that everything is combined perfectly. 
            </li>
            <li>Your water should be boiling now, add your pasta. 
            </li>
            <li>When the sauce becomes a good consistency and color, lower the heat to medium-low and add a few handfuls of parmigiano reggiano while stirring.</li>
            <li>Taste for seasoning and add as needed.
            </li>
            <li>Strain your pasta and keep a cup of the pasta water adding it to the sauce to thicken it up and add flavor. 
            </li>
            <li>Sprinkle basil into the pasta sauce and add your pasta.
            </li>
            <li>Lastly, add a nob of butter to the pasta you have already put into the sauce and mix. Bon appetito!</li>

         <h12>Cacio e Pepe</h12>
         <p>This is a very simple pasta recipe that will satisfy your late night pasta craving. I like to call it "adult mac and cheese." It only requires about 3 ingredients and tastes amazing in its creamy cheesy goodness.</p>

         <h13>Ingredients</h13>
         <ul>
             <li>Cracked fresh ground black pepper</li>
             <li>Salt</li>
             <li>Parmeggiano reggiano</li>
             <li>Long pasta (angle hair, spaghetti, etc)</li>
         </ul>

        <h14>Directions</h14>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by boiling your heavily salted pasta water.</li>
            <li>Heat up a pan and add a generous amount of black pepper to toast it.</li>
            <li>While your pepper toasts, start to cook your pasta.</li>
            <li>In a seperate bowl, add your desired amount of Parmeggiano reggiano.</li>
            <li>Just as your pasta is about to finish cooking, take a small amount of that water and pour it bit my bit into your parmesan bowl. Mix until you develop a sort of paste. (WARNING: You do not want your parmesan to melt during this step)</li>
            <li>Add a cup of pasta water to your pepper pan and then add your pasta.</li>
            <li>Mix your pasta with the pepper.</li>
            <li>Once a good amount of the water has burned off, reduce the heat to low and add your parmesan paste.</li>
            <li>Mix thoroughly until your pasta combines resulting in a creamy cheesy sauce. Bon appetito!</li>
