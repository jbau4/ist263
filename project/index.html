        </div>
           <p>
                Chef Jack “Bau Bau” Bautista is a self proclaimed culinary master from a small town in Connecticut. He learned his divine cooking skills from his mother who was taught by her father. However, it wasn’t until the great Covid 19 pandemic of 2020 that Chef Jack harnessed his craft. Housebound without a restaurant to feast, Chef Jack relied on himself and only himself to satisfy his cravings. It was a dark and dreary time but in the midst of all this dread something amazing was created. Chef Jack, a boy once known just for his magnificent grilled cheeses, was now a renowned culinary artist. He started cooking large meals for his family of 8 as well as experimenting with a variety of cuisines from traditional america to the exotic Japanese. Despite his tastes for the exotic, Chef Jack’s true favorite foods to cook will always lie within the simplicity of pasta. At the end of the day, if everybody has a happy tummy, Chef Jack feels that he has done his job…
